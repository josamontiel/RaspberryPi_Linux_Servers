# VPN

I have set up a simple VPN (Virtual private network) using [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/)

To install, in your RPi env, in the terminal, run the following command ```https://www.pivpn.io/```

The VPN is not very useful at the minute as there are no services provided on the Rpi, but, as this server grows and more services are added, it could prove useful.
