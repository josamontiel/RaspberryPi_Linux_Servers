# RaspberryPi_Linux_Servers
Building out various services using Raspberry Pi

This build was set up as a headless set up, with some extra configuration I was able to achieve this. This means I do not need ant I/O devices like monitors, keyborads etc. I ssh into it and do what it is I need to do. 

I ssh'd into it from my laptop (pictured below)

This whole set up cost me like $100 and opens up a lot of possibilites since i installed it with a 256GB sd card. 

May use it to set up a NAS, Web server, Firewall, VPN etc. Plenty of possibilites.
