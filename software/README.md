# Software used for the project

1. Raspberry Pi OS
2. BRaspbeery Pi Imager
<!--3. OpenVPN-->

The people over at the Pi Foundation have a Debian-based distro which made set up super easy, as this is a 4GB set up I did not want something too heavy on it. The pi OS is will do all I need it to do, for now.
